    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>The CoFestival is an independent event which is free of charge and which aims at promoting two key aspects:</p>
    <h4>Discovery</h4>
    <p>We wish to share and transfer scientific and technological know-how in an accessible and inclusive way, in order to encourage learning and reusing knowledge by anyone who is interested.</p>
    <h4>Openness</h4>
    <p>because science and technology can also be exclusionary and closed, we want to create a space for sharing and reflecting about possible strategies to change this. We know that the scientific and technological expertise so valued today can also be a means to discriminate and create a power inbalance between those who master it and those who don’t. We want to break through the wall that allows this inequality.</p>
    <p>By proposing different formats and events (technical and fun workshops, unconferences, debates, artistic performances, “confèrences gesticulées” - theatre-conferences), we want to make your neurons dance and glow!</p>
    <p>We are committed to making the CoFestival accessible and welcoming to everyone, in accordance with the principles of our <a href="#coc">code of conduct</a> which we kindly invite you to read.</p>

   <h2><a class="anchor" name="coc">Code of conduct</a></h2>
  </div>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Please ask for permission before photographing, video recording, audio recording anyone in the area captured by your device (this includes Google Glass, GoPros or similar devices). This also applies to anything that could be used to identify someone (tattoo, computer, ...). Those who agree to be recorded (audio, photo, video) will have a distinctive label. Anyone without such a label must not appear in your recordings. An announcement will be made if a conference is to be recorded.</li>
    <li>The CoFestival is open to everyone, even after it ends. We would like the recordings taken during the event to be distributed under a CC BY-SA license (or other license authorising sharing).</li>
    <li>Please be friendly and inclusive : discrimination is the only thing we intned to exclude from the CoFestival.</li>
    <li>Should there be any problems or conflicts of any kind : let's discuss them. CoFestival organisers can be contacted by telephone and they are there to listen and deal with any problems you may have related to the CoFestival.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h4><a class="anchor" name="coc-intervention">For speakers/workshop facilitators :</a></h4>
  <p>Please respect CoFestival values by providing a welcoming and inclusive environnement in each workshop, conference and in any other activity during the festival !</p>
  <p>Here are some guidelines so that your participation reflects the spirit of the CoFestival:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't forget to explain any technical terms that you use. Jargon can also be exclusionary.</li>
    <li>Banish all discriminatory language during your presentation (for example, jokes that include offensive stereotypes or that focus on certain groups of people). Please consider that people who feel targeted by such discrimination (disabilities, mental illness, sexual orientation, gender, social class…) could be in the audiance.</li>
    <li>Verify that your workshop material does not contain elements that could shock, or that reproduce oppressions , nor videos or media that blink or are displayed in a way that they create a stroboscopic effect. If your workshop/conference includes emotionally evocative content, announce it via a trigger warning at the start of the workshop.</li>
    <li>In order to remain accessible to all, remember not to speak too fast and to always describe the contents of your presentation materials (slides...). This allows visually impaired people to participate more easily.</li>
    <li>If you notice problematic behaviour in your workshop, act on it : stop and tell the person that what he/she is doing is problematic. In the case of a disagreement, postpone the discussion until the end of the workshop in order to avoid disrupting the group. If the problem persists, try to find a member of the festival organisation committee.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>If you have any concerns pertaining to your workshop/talk or about your material, please don't hesitate to discuss them with us on the <a href="mailto:discussion@cofestival.org">discussion@cofestival.org</a> mailing list, where someone will be able to give you advice.</p>
